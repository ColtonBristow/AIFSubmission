          "description": "Hannah More (1745 – 1833) was an English poet, playwright, educator and philanthropist. Her father, a schoolmaster, provided an opportunity for young Hannah to receive a formal education.  More eventually founded 12 schools throughout the Somerset, England area and was an advocate for the poor and women’s welfare. Later in life her writing became more evangelical and More joined a group opposing the slave trade. Her poem, “Slavery, a Poem” argued that skin color should not determine personhood. The poem was written in support of William Wilberforce’s campaign to abolish slavery and became one of the most important pieces of literature regarding the abolitionist movement.\n\nMore’s influential writing provided a powerful voice in her joint campaign to abolish slavery with William Wilberforce. 19 years after More’s famous “Slavery” poem, she and Wilberforce saw the fruits of the labor through a bill that was passed that ended the slave trade."

A note following his inscription, but written in a different hand, states that it was “purchased by him in June 1876.” The handwritten note following George Wilson Rigg’s signature is written with a different hand in the passive tense, suggesting the owner after Rigg wrote the note. An inscription written in pencil on the back endpapers states, “Sotheby. 5.vi.50 as part of Lot 15.” Sotheby’s has provided no additional information. Additional notes in pencil written by an unknown “E. N.” are present on the front endpapers. It is unclear who “E. N.” was and if the notes were written by the same hand. A bookplate on the front pastedown states Smith’s name, Zion Research Library, and the year “1957.” Marguerite Smith was a librarian at Zion Research Library in Massachusetts and worked in the National Woman's Party."
